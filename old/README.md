# Michael's Portfolio

## Hay! :wave: 

Welcome to my portfolio, it's not much but it's mine. You can find what I'm good at, how to get in touch and some of the projects I've worked on over the years.

## Well, seeing as you're hear...

I'm a Full Stack web developer specialising in UI & UX development, currently working freelance. I work with a large group of different tech stacks, my favourite at the moment being `NodeJs`, `Typescript`, `JS` and `Vue2 & 3`. Check out the portfolio for more [michaelhillcox.com](https://michaelhillcox.com).

Feel free to get in touch via [me@mhfs.dev](mailto:me@mhfs.dev) or [me@michaelhillcox.com](mailto:me@michaelhillcox.comv) for a chat üòÅ
