        If you have a project in mind or already in the works but are looking for an awesome Design & Developer or just a Designer or just a Developer
        than I could be just right for you. I love working projects that push my existing knowledge and get me out of my confort zone. Just drop me a line at
        hello@michaelhillcox.co.uk. Iâ€™m currently available for small - large projects and would love to hear all about it.
