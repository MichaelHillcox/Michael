# Michael's Portfolio
This is my portfolio website. It used to be written in PHP but has recently been
ported over to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). In an effort to keep my portfolio as
up to date and up to spec as I possibly can; Iâ€™m throwing it out into the wild to force me to keep updating, rethinking and redesigning the project as much logically possible.

# Using
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Zeptojs](http://zeptojs.com/)
