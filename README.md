# Welcome to my Portfolio

Hello and welcome :wave:! My name is Michael, or Mikey, and this is my portfolio. Although I'm not actively seeking freelance work at the moment, I make an effort to keep my portfolio up to date. With over 10 years of experience in the web industry, I am constantly learning, creating, tinkering, and exploring. I hope to showcase my knowledge and skills that I've gained over the years through this website. Thanks for stopping by!
